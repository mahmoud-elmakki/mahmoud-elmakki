# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Mahmoud Elmakki, Thank you for your visit! Let me introduce myself to you,
In mid Sep 2022 I've started my final year of my five-year bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Integrated with a four-year journey of learning and self-studying programming, Computer Science, Deep Learning and Computational Neuroscience. All combined with my theoratical and practical knowledge in Machine Learning, made me able, in my third year, to find work positions, both as Software Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer.
